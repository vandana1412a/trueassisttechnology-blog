          while travelling due to physical limitations. The good news is, there are assistive devices available that cater

        <h2>Understanding Arthritis and Its Impact on Driving</h2>
        <p>Before we start exploring the best cars for seniors with arthritis, it is important to understand what arthritis is and how it affects driving abilities.</p>

        <h3>What is Arthritis?</h3>
        <p>
          Arthritis is a medical condition that affects the joints in the body, leading to inflammation, pain, and
          stiffness. There are over 100 types of arthritis, but the most common types among seniors are osteoarthritis and
          rheumatoid arthritis.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Challenges Faced by Seniors with Arthritis While Driving</h3>
        <p>
          Seniors with arthritis often face challenges such as entering and exiting the car, buckling seat belts, and
          resting the leg. These challenges can be especially challenging when driving for long periods.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important for seniors with arthritis to take extra precautions. This includes regular exercise to maintain
          joint mobility and strength, getting enough rest before travelling, and taking breaks during long travel to
          stretch and rest. Seniors with arthritis should also consider modifications to their vehicle to make driving
          more comfortable and less strenuous.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also important for seniors with arthritis to choose a car that is easy to get in and out of, with
          comfortable seats and good visibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          One modification that can help seniors with arthritis is a swivel seat. This can make it easier to enter and
          exit the car and reduce the strain. Seat cushions and lumbar supports can also improve comfort and reduce pain
          while travelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, seniors with arthritis can continue to travel safely and enjoy life with proper precautions and
          modifications. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional.
