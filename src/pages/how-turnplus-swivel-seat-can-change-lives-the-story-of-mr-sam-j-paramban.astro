    <p>
      When illness strikes, it affects more than just health—it reshapes daily life, routines, and even the smallest of
      movements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Sam J. Paramban, Head of Operations at Tryzens India, was living an active professional life until a sudden
      cardiac arrest changed everything. The incident caused severe brain damage, leading to loss of eyesight, memory,
      and mobility. He is now bedridden, relying on constant care from his family.
    </p>

    <h2>A Journey of Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      After spending two months in KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, and another four months in CMC Vellore, Mr. Sam
      was discharged without major improvement. His family continues to take him for outpatient physiotherapy,
      determined to give him every chance at recovery despite the heavy emotional and financial toll.
    </p>

    <h2>A Glimpse of Hope</h2>
    <p>
      While at the hospital, the family noticed an Innova car fitted with the TurnPlus swivel seat—a special swivel seat
      for car transfers designed to make entering and exiting a vehicle easier for people with mobility challenges. This
      sight sparked a thought: Could this make life easier for Sam and his caregivers?
    </p>

    <h2>The Mobility Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Sam’s 6-foot-plus height and well-built frame make transfers into a car extremely difficult. Even with assistance,
      the strain on both the patient and caregivers is immense. His family began exploring the possibility of using
      TurnPlus, along with a portable ramp, but cost remained a concern due to ongoing medical expenses.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond Just a Product</h2>
    <p>TurnPlus is more than a mechanism—it’s a bridge to independence and dignity. For people like Mr. Sam, it can mean:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less physical strain for caregivers</li>
      <li>Safer and more comfortable transfers</li>
      <li>The freedom to attend physiotherapy or family outings without stress</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For families across India, TurnPlus is one of the most practical swivel car seat for disabled in India solutions,
      often called a wheelchair car seat India option. It’s more than hardware—it’s a lifeline.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      The family is also exploring innovations like a professional-grade turntable platform that could allow a
      wheelchair user to stand, rotate, and transfer into a seat with ease—something our engineering team could
      potentially design in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mobility is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. Stories like Mr. Sam’s remind us why we continue to innovate, customize,
      and make mobility solutions for caregivers and users more affordable and adaptable.
